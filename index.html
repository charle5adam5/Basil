            Born, fortunately, in a land 'by-the-sea', glowing with 
            radiant beauties all around, Basil's sensitivities 
            (like most youngsters) became touched with natural beauty:
                <img class='partial' src='./images/partial1.jpg' />
            His father was an avid gardener, so his early homelife was infused 
            with gardenias, jasmine and lemon blossoms ( in season) growing 
            about his yard and under his bedroom windows.
            
            About the neighborhood, the skies were filled with Royal Poinciana Trees,
              in brilliant orange-red flowers, lavender orchid tree blooms, 
              and bougainvilleas, violets and purples.
            
            In summertime huge clouds billow up, towering and fill up 
            gigantic spaces til the summits (in jet stream currents)  break apart.
            
            In the bushes, along the ground, slithering bright green snakes used to 
            surprise one; Rainbow tinted scales of indigo snakes might even appear.
            <img class='partial' src='./images/partial2.jpg' />
            Neon pink and banana-yellow hibiscus flowers filled hedges and yards 
            everywhere. The happiness of tropical palms, and rain-fulfilled flora, 
            (plants of all kinds) radiated a happiness throughout.
            
            This legacy of living and growing up in a unique beauty (all around) 
            lives on in Basil's innate heart, a love of nature and creation itself.

            <p>
             My "Way" of painting derives from years of study, teacher feedback and practicing.
             
             <img class='partial' src='./images/partial3.jpg' />

           As I mature, both a centered calmness and inner contentment develop --proven essential factors for success. Thus: aware of both heart and mind in a harmony, I start painting by just letting myself "go". (My own experience found that pre-conceived notions, held to fixedly, usually results into a less than desirable performance).
             
            
         
         Thus: following a spontaneous outpouring in movement of brush, and  my emotional reaction to their resultant colors and strokes --a direction and images slowly build up and guide me into a composition. Somewhat similar to dance partners, one leading and one following, --my hand and my eyes constantly "play" off each other. Some people have called this activity a sort-of 'channeling'...(or, allowing a deep level of sub-consciousness to take over).
            
            <img class='partial' src='./images/partial6.jpg' />
        
         As I begin, a vague idea may be lingering, it's true; a special feeling may well be strong, evident.
         But no intention, no certain purpose of fixed destination, forms (or objects to delineate) are decided upon.
            
        
         
         Years of painting (below) have granted me a certain confidence, and I have learned to trust myself.
            
        
         The vagueness of layered washes, or strokes of rhythms eventually grow and build into suggestions, and a guidance lights me. I then trust into whatever ideas, forms or images become manifest --call to me, become attractive.
            
        
         Because 'all of creation' moves me deeply: Seas, Skies, Landscapes/Mountains and Valleys, are oftentimes conjured up.
            
            <img class='partial' src='./images/partial5.jpg' />
        
         I believe that which I love the most, (those forms that move me best), make my best paintings "live", with unique ideas and feeling.
            
        
         Oftentimes my brushes' path (and expressive movements) reveal something of the artists' own creative excitement, and so additionally may excite and maybe inspire the viewer as well.
            
        
         I never try to mirror outside 'reality', but rely upon unconsciousness, hidden memories and even fantasy to prove worth, connect to others, and glorify our human existence.
