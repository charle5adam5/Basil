       <p>
       Born, fortunately, in a land 'by-the-sea' (Miami) , glowing with radiant beauty all around, Basil's sensitivities (like most youngsters) became touched with natural beauty:  His father was an avid gardener, so his early homelife was infused with gardenias, jasmine and lemon blossoms (in season) growing about his yard and under his bedroom windows.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       <div><h3> Youth </h3></div>
       
       
       Fortune bequeathed to Basil, not a monetary position, but a special geographic place, a (1950's) South Miami Florida, filled with optimism, safety and community. Neighbors shared, cared and communicated; Homes, (landscaped with blossoms), filled breezes with scents of jasmine, citrus-and-lime in season; gardenias wafted in the mornings, and flower-color variations of trees, (against the skies), competed with rainbows, in brilliance. Lush, prosperous neighborhoods offered-up fruits: papaya, guava, Barbados-cherries, and myriad, delicious mango flavors. It was a nurturing nest for budding hedonists; Natures' expressions spoke into both vastness,... as well as in miniature: Billowing summer clouds touched the summits' skies of heaven-- A hummingbirds' iridescence, so easily overlooked.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       <div><h3> Teenage Years </h3></div>
       
       
       B's older sister, awakened Basil to the music and style and ways of her generation,...honest, sincere expression, dance and rock-n-roll. B's mother worked as a typist to local scientists and resident writers, read voraciously and wrote columns and reviews in the community newspaper. I learned to revere learning and enjoyed discussions of ideas and even controversy. B's father was a civics teacher, by profession, yet also capable of building almost anything. His first love became plants, trees and the great outdoors. He introduced Basil to the wilds of the Everglades--a unique gift communing with birds of all kinds, reptiles and mammals.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       <div><h3> Adult Years </h3></div>
       
       
       Basil studied social sciences at Tallahassee's Fla. State University--yet quickly evolved into a career as journalist, editor and researcher.  At the United States Patent and Trademark Offices Basil, found his life-career. He preformed research for Patent Attorneys, all across the country. Basil's 'product', (in form of technical paper), displayed all those pertinent patents, revealing similarities to the proffered invention, submitted. Thus, for about twenty-five years Basil performed happily here.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Upon retirement, Basil purchased houses needing renovation; By applying intention and energy, he learned many building trades and profited several times, and saving many old homes from ruin.

       <section class="content">
       <p>
       My "Way" of painting derives from years of study, teacher feedback and practicing.  As I mature, both a centered calmness and inner contentment develop --proven essential factors for success. Thus: aware of both heart and mind in a harmony, I start painting by just letting myself "go". (My own experience found that pre-conceived notions, held to fixedly, usually results into a less than desirable performance).
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Thus: following a spontaneous outpouring in movement of brush, and my emotional reaction to their resultant colors and strokes --a direction and images slowly build up and guide me into a composition.  Somewhat similar to dance partners, one leading and one following, --my hand and my eyes constantly "play" off each other. Some people have called this activity a sort-of 'channeling'...(or, allowing a deep level of sub-consciousness to take over).
       </p>
       
       <p>
       As I begin, a vague idea may be lingering, it's true; a special feeling may well be strong, evident. But no intention, no certain purpose of fixed destination, forms (or objects to delineate) are decided upon. Years of painting (below) have granted me a certain confidence, and I have learned to trust myself. The vagueness of layered washes, or strokes of rhythms eventually grow and build into suggestions, and a guidance lights me. I then trust into whatever ideas, forms or images become manifest --call to me, become attractive.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Because 'all of creation' moves me deeply: Seas, Skies, Landscapes/Mountains and Valleys, are oftentimes conjured up.  I believe that which I love the most, (those forms that move me best), make my best paintings "live", with unique ideas and feeling. Oftentimes my brushes' path (and expressive movements) reveal something of the artists' own creative excitement, and so additionally may excite and maybe inspire the viewer as well.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       I never try to mirror outside 'reality', but rely upon unconsciousness, hidden memories and even fantasy to prove worth, connect to others, and glorify our human existence.
